How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  I can ensure that my software is functional and secure through specifically testing it's functionality and security. These tests can be either automated or done through human interaction

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  By turning user needs into requirements, I write my program with the intention to fulfill the software functionality requirements. Each user need does not necessitate an exact parallel requirement, as some user needs require more functionality that cannot be encompassed within a single requirement.

How do I approach designing software?
  I approach the designing of software as developing a service to meet a client's need. As the end goal of the software is for the client to interact with some service, designing the software with that interaction in mind is my main priority. If the client doesn't feel that the software provides the quality of service they desire, it is on me as the developer to correct the errors within my means to satisfy the client.
